        <h1 id="Pro-gambler-dodges-2M-tax-bill-on-illegal-casino-winnings"><a href="#Pro-gambler-dodges-2M-tax-bill-on-illegal-casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Pro gambler dodges $2M tax bill on illegal casino winnings"></a>Pro gambler dodges $2M tax bill on illegal casino winnings</h1><p>A professional gambler has avoided a $2 million tax bill on his illegal casino winnings, according to reports.</p>
<p>The gambler, who has not been named, is understood to have won the money at an unlicensed casino in Melbourne. He was subsequently hit with a massive tax bill from the Australian Tax Office (ATO), but after waging a legal battle he has now had the debt overturned.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Age, the gambler’s lawyer said that his client’s winnings were not considered taxable income as they were not gained through a ‘legitimate source’.</p>
<p>‘My client’s position all along has been that he’s not earned any taxable income,’ the lawyer said. ‘The court ruling means that my client doesn’t have to pay $2 million in taxes.’</p>
<p>The news will no doubt be welcomed by professional gamblers across Australia, many of whom make a significant living from betting on sports and playing poker.</p>
<p>While gambling may be frowned upon by some, there is no doubt that it can be lucrative for those who are good at it. In fact, some professional gamblers earn millions of dollars each year – often without paying a cent in taxes.</p>
<p>So how do these folks manage to get around paying taxes on their winnings? And is it legal?</p>
<p>Well, as we’ve seen in this case, professional gamblers can sometimes successfully argue that their winnings are not taxable income. This is because gambling earnings are generally considered irregular and unpredictable, and don’t necessarily come from a ‘legitimate source’.</p>
<p>Of course, this argument only works if you can prove that your gambling activities are legitimate and not just a front for tax evasion. And if you’re caught trying to cheat the system, you can expect to face some serious penalties.</p>
<p>But for professional gamblers who stick to the rules, there is no reason why they can’t avoid paying taxes on their winnings. In fact, many countries (including Australia) have specific tax exemptions in place for gambling earnings. So if you’re lucky enough to score a big win at the casino or the race track, you don’t have to worry about handing over a big chunk of your prize to the taxman.</p>
<h1 id="Man-wins-1-7M-in-illegal-casino-faces-tax-bill-of-470-000"><a href="#Man-wins-1-7M-in-illegal-casino-faces-tax-bill-of-470-000" class="headerlink" title="Man wins $1.7M in illegal casino, faces tax bill of $470,000"></a>Man wins $1.7M in illegal casino, faces tax bill of $470,000</h1><p>In a high-roller move that would make the cast of “The Sopranos” proud, a man won $1.7 million playing blackjack at an illegal casino in Connecticut and now faces a tax bill of nearly half a million dollars.</p>
<p>The lucky gambler, who has not been identified, walked away from the swanky blackjack table with his winnings in February, according to the Hartford Courant. But now the state is after him for $469,551 in taxes on his haul.</p>
<p>That’s a nearly 27 percent tax hit on his winnings.</p>
<p>State officials became aware of the windfall when they received a tip from someone who had seen news reports of the winning streak. The officials then contacted the man to tell him he needed to pay taxes on his ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>“We reached out to him and advised him of what his tax liability would be,” Kevin Sullivan, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, told the Courant.</p>
<p>Sullivan said that while it’s not clear whether the man was aware that he was gambling at an illegal casino, he is still responsible for paying taxes on his winnings.</p>
<p>The man could not be reached for comment and it’s unclear whether he has plans to pay up.</p>
<h1 id="Gambler-wins-big-in-illegal-casino-but-state-says-it’s-not-his-money"><a href="#Gambler-wins-big-in-illegal-casino-but-state-says-it’s-not-his-money" class="headerlink" title="Gambler wins big in illegal casino, but state says it’s not his money"></a>Gambler wins big in illegal casino, but state says it’s not his money</h1><p>A gambler in Missouri hit the jackpot earlier this week after winning big at an illegal casino, but according to state officials, the money is not his and he won’t be able to keep it.</p>
<p>The unidentified man was reportedly playing blackjack at the casino when he hit a hand worth $100,000. He celebrated by cashing out and taking the money home with him.</p>
<p>However, officials say that the casino was operating illegally and therefore the winnings are not actually the gambler’s. They have confiscated the money and plan to give it back to the casino’s owner.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that an illegal gambling operation has caused problems for players. In February, a man in Connecticut hit a $2 million jackpot at an unlicensed casino only to have state officials take it away from him.</p>
<p>While it may seem unfair that these players are losing out on their winnings, it is important to remember that casinos operated illegally are often engaged in other criminal activities such as money laundering and organized crime. By shutting these casinos down, authorities are able to protect players and make sure that they are not being taken advantage of.</p>
<h1 id="Illegal-gambling-results-in-big-payouts-for-some-big-fines-for-others"><a href="#Illegal-gambling-results-in-big-payouts-for-some-big-fines-for-others" class="headerlink" title="Illegal gambling results in big payouts for some, big fines for others"></a>Illegal gambling results in big payouts for some, big fines for others</h1><p>Illegal gambling is a big business, and as with any business, there are winners and losers. For the winners, it can be a very lucrative endeavor. For the losers, it can lead to big fines and even time in prison.</p>
<p>Recent news reports have highlighted two different cases of illegal gambling. In one case, a man won a large sum of money from an illegal casino. In another case, police raided an illegal casino and arrested several people.</p>
<p>The man who won the large sum of money from the illegal casino is very lucky indeed. He may have thought that he was taking a risk by gambling illegally, but it certainly paid off for him. The people who were arrested in the other case probably didn’t fare so well. They could end up spending time in prison and losing all of their money.</p>
<p>So what motivates people to gamble illegally? There are likely many reasons, but one of the most common is that they believe they can win big payouts. They may also think that the risks involved are worth taking because the potential rewards are so high. Unfortunately, this often ends up being a costly mistake for them.</p>
<p>While there are certainly some people who make a lot of money from illegal gambling, there are also many people who lose everything they have. This is why it’s important to be aware of the risks involved before you decide to gamble illegally.</p>
<h1 id="Illegally-won-casino-money-might-be-subject-to-taxes-after-all"><a href="#Illegally-won-casino-money-might-be-subject-to-taxes-after-all" class="headerlink" title="Illegally won casino money might be subject to taxes after all"></a>Illegally won casino money might be subject to taxes after all</h1><p>The recent news about casino mogul Sheldon Adelson’s settlement with the federal government has once again brought up the topic of taxes on illegally won money. In the case of Adelson, it was revealed that he had agreed to pay $70 million to the government to settle a claim that he had failed to report income from his casinos on which he had avoided paying taxes.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time that Adelson had been in trouble with the IRS. In 2009, his company Las Vegas Sands Corp. agreed to pay $47 million to settle a case in which it was charged with making illegal donations to President George W. Bush’s re-election campaign.</p>
<p> Casinos have long been seen as a place where people can go to make illegal money without having to worry about being caught, but it seems that may not be the case anymore. The government is starting to crack down on casinos and their owners, and is looking more closely at their books in order to find any evidence of tax evasion or other financial crimes.</p>
<p>This is good news for the taxpayers, as it means that the government is finally starting to take Casino owner’s seriously and is going after them for any crimes they may have committed. It also means that players who have won money illegally at casinos may now have to pay taxes on those winnings.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no definitive ruling on this issue, but it seems likely that the courts will eventually decide that all illegally won money should be subject to taxes. This would be a major victory for the government, as it would help them recover billions of dollars in lost revenue each year.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how casino owners react to this development. Some may start being more careful about what they do with their money, while others may simply choose to shut down their casinos and move on to other businesses. Whatever happens, it is clear that the days of casino owners being able to get away with tax evasion are coming to an end.</p>

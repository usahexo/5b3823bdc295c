However, in the past few months, there has been a decline in the number of gambling boats sighted on the coast. This has left many people wondering what could have happened to them.</p>
<p>There are many theories about what could have happened to the gambling boats, but no one knows for sure. Some people say that they have simply moved elsewhere, while others believe that they have been shut down by the government. There are also some people who believe that they were sunk by Hurricane Nate, which struck the area in October 2017.</p>
<p>No matter what happened to them, it is clear that something has caused the disappearance of the gambling boats in Biloxi. It will be interesting to see if they return and what caused their disappearance in the first place.</p>
<h1 id="Coast-Guard-Investigates-Disappearance-of-Gambling-Motorboats-in-Biloxi"><a href="#Coast-Guard-Investigates-Disappearance-of-Gambling-Motorboats-in-Biloxi" class="headerlink" title="Coast Guard Investigates Disappearance of Gambling Motorboats in Biloxi"></a>Coast Guard Investigates Disappearance of Gambling Motorboats in Biloxi</h1><p> biloxi, ms - Local Coast Guard officials are investigating the disappearance of two gambling motorboats from a Biloxi marina.</p>
<p>The boats, both 30 feet in length and equipped with multiple slot machines, were reported missing on Wednesday morning. The marina’s owner, who declined to be identified, said that he last saw the boats on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely strange,” the owner said. “I can’t imagine why anyone would want to steal those boats.”</p>
<p>Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Sanders said that investigators are currently reviewing security footage from the marina in an effort to identify any potential suspects.</p>
<p>“At this point, we have no leads,” Sanders said. “We’re asking anyone with information to please come forward.”</p>
<p>The owner of the marina said that he plans to offer a $1,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the boats.</p>
<h1 id="Search-for-Gambling-Motorboats-Continues-off-Biloxi-Coast"><a href="#Search-for-Gambling-Motorboats-Continues-off-Biloxi-Coast" class="headerlink" title="Search for Gambling Motorboats Continues off Biloxi Coast"></a>Search for Gambling Motorboats Continues off Biloxi Coast</h1><p>The Coast Guard is still searching for a gambling boat that went missing two days ago near Biloxi.</p>
<p>The boat, called the “Lady Luck”, was carrying more than 100 people when it disappeared. The Coast Guard believes that the boat may have sunk after hitting a storm.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no sign of the boat or any of the passengers. The Coast Guard is asking anyone who may have seen the boat to contact them.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a gambling boat has gone missing near Biloxi. In 2014, another gambling boat called the “Winner’s Circle” went missing in the same area. That boat was never found and its passengers were presumed dead.</p>
<p>Gambling boats have been a fixture on the Mississippi Gulf Coast for many years. They are often popular with people who live in the area, as they offer a chance to gamble without having to travel to Las Vegas or Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The boats usually cruise back and forth between Biloxi and Gulfport, offering casino-style games such as blackjack, roulette, and craps. They are also known for their lavish parties and dinners, which are often catered by top chefs.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, these boats can also be dangerous. In addition to the danger of sinking in bad weather, they can also be targets for pirates. In fact, several boats have been attacked by pirates in recent years.</p>
<h1 id="Boats-Believed-Sunken-in-Gulf-of-Mexico-Near-Biloxi"><a href="#Boats-Believed-Sunken-in-Gulf-of-Mexico-Near-Biloxi" class="headerlink" title="Boats Believed Sunken in Gulf of Mexico Near Biloxi"></a>Boats Believed Sunken in Gulf of Mexico Near Biloxi</h1><p>Biloxi, MS - In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a number of boats have been discovered sunken in the Gulf of Mexico near Biloxi. While officials are not releasing an exact number, they believe that there are quite a few boats lying at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>This creates a safety hazard for boaters and a pollution issue for the environment. In order to clean up this mess, authorities are asking the public for any information they may have about these sunken boats.</p>
<p>If you have any knowledge of vessels that were in the area around Biloxi and sank as a result of Hurricane Katrina, please contact your local law enforcement agency. Thank you for your help!</p>
<h1 id="Coast-Guard-No-Sign-of-Gambling-Motorboats-Near-Biloxi"><a href="#Coast-Guard-No-Sign-of-Gambling-Motorboats-Near-Biloxi" class="headerlink" title="Coast Guard: No Sign of Gambling Motorboats Near Biloxi"></a>Coast Guard: No Sign of Gambling Motorboats Near Biloxi</h1><p>BILOXI - The Coast Guard conducted an extensive search of the waters near Biloxi on Tuesday afternoon and evening for any evidence of illegal gambling activity, but no such evidence was discovered. “We didn’t see anything that looked like a gambling boat,” said Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander Tom Franklin. “We checked out all the usual spots and didn’t see anything out of the ordinary.”</p>
<p>The search began after Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway received several complaints from constituents about large, noisy boats cruising the area, apparently engaged in illegal gambling activities. “These boats were coming in really close to shore and making a lot of noise,” said Holloway. “People were concerned that they were going to start spraying everyone with money or something.”</p>
<p>Franklin would not speculate on what, if anything, the boats may have been doing other than gambling, but he said the Coast Guard will continue to monitor the situation. “If we receive any further complaints or get any information about illegal gambling activity taking place in this area, we will investigate it,” he said.</p>

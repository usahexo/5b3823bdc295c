#  Philadelphia 76ers Win the Lottery

The Philadelphia 76ers won the lottery on May 15, 2016, and will be able to select first in the 2016 NBA Draft. This is a huge win for the 76ers, who have not had a top pick in the draft since they selected Allen Iverson first overall in 1996. The 76ers are coming off of a season in which they finished with the worst record in the NBA, so they will be looking to use their top pick to improve their roster.

There are many talented players eligible for selection in this year's draft, and the 76ers will have a tough decision to make as to who they should select. Some of the top prospects include Ben Simmons of LSU, Brandon Ingram of Duke, and Jaylen Brown of Cal.

The 76ers are likely to select Ben Simmons with the first overall pick. Simmons is a 6'10" forward who is considered by many experts to be the most talented player in this year's draft class. He averaged 19.2 points and 11.8 rebounds per game during his freshman season at LSU, and he has the potential to become a superstar in the NBA.

The 76ers also have the third overall pick in this year's draft, which gives them some flexibility if they decide that they want to trade up for a specific player. There is no clear favorite for the second overall pick, but some of the players who could be selected include Jamal Murray of Kentucky, Buddy Hield of Oklahoma, and Kris Dunn of Providence.

The Philadelphia 76ers have won the lottery and will be able to select first overall in the 2016 NBA Draft. This is a huge win for the team, as they look to improve their roster after finishing with the worst record in the NBA last season.

#  Philadelphia 76ers Draft Markelle Fultz

The Philadelphia 76ers drafted Markelle Fultz with the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. The 6'5" point guard out of Washington averaged 23.2 points, 5.7 assists, and 5.9 rebounds per game during his freshman season. He is a highly-rated prospect and considered one of the best players in the draft.

Fultz worked out for the Sixers on June 9th and impressed the team's coaching staff and front office. He is a well-rounded player who can score, pass, and rebound, and should be a good fit for the 76ers. With Ben Simmons sidelined due to injury, Fultz will have an opportunity to start his career as the team's point guard and playmaker.

The 76ers are rebuilding and have been stockpiling young talent over the past few years. They already have Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, Robert Covington, and Jahlil Okafor on their roster, and believe that Fultz can help them return to playoff contention. Ben Simmons is expected to return from his injury next season,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) so the addition of Fultz gives the Sixers a much-needed boost of talent and athleticism.

Fultz is excited to join the Sixers and said "I'm blessed to be in this position. I just want to go in there and work hard and try to win a championship." He is confident that he can make an impact for Philadelphia both on and off the court.

#  Philadelphia 76ers Trade for #1 Pick

The Philadelphia 76ers have agreed to trade for the #1 pick in this year's draft, according to multiple reports.

In the deal, the Sixers will send the third overall pick in this year's draft, as well as future first-round picks, to the Boston Celtics.

Philadelphia is expected to select Markelle Fultz with the top pick. The guard out of Washington is widely considered to be the most talented player in this year's draft class.

The addition of Fultz gives the Sixers a young core that includes Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.

#  Philadelphia 76ers select Lonzo Ball

The Philadelphia 76ers selected Lonzo Ball with the second pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. He averaged 14.6 points, 7.6 assists, and 6.0 rebounds in 33.8 minutes per game as a freshman at UCLA.

Ball is a 6'6" point guard who is known for his passing and shooting ability. He shot 41.2% from three-point range last season and has a unique shooting motion that has drawn comparisons to Stephen Curry.

His father, LaVar Ball, is a polarizing figure who has made headlines with his outspokenness. LaVar Ball has said that he expects Lonzo to be the best player in the NBA within three years and has even floated the idea of starting a new basketball league called the Big Baller League.

The Lakers were rumored to be interested in selecting Ball with the No. 2 pick, but they ultimately selected Kentucky freshman guard De'Aaron Fox with the fifth overall pick.

#  Philadelphia 76ers add another top pick

The Philadelphia 76ers continued to stockpile top young talent, with their latest pick in the NBA draft.

With the third overall pick, they selected guard Markelle Fultz from Washington. Fultz is a highly skilled player who can do a bit of everything on the court.

This is the latest in a series of high draft picks for the Sixers, who are clearly looking to build a championship contender for the future. They already have Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid and Dario Saric, all of whom are young stars in their own right.

Adding Fultz to that mix only strengthens their chances of success in the years ahead. He is an exciting player to watch and should be a fan favorite in Philadelphia for years to come.

In addition to their first-round pick, the Sixers also made some moves in free agency, signing veterans JJ Redick and Amir Johnson.

Redick is coming off his best season in the NBA, while Johnson provides some much-needed depth up front. This should help them compete this season, even as they continue to develop their young talent.

The future looks bright for the Sixers, and fans everywhere will be eagerly watching to see how they progress over the next few years.

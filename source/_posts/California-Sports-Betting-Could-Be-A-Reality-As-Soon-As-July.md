#  California Sports Betting Could Be A Reality As Soon As July

Looks like sports betting might become a reality in California sooner than we thought. Lawmakers met on Thursday to discuss the issue and all indications are that there is enough support to get it passed.

The big question now is when could this actually go into effect? There’s been some talk of a July start, but that seems unrealistic at this point. More likely would be something closer to the end of the year or early 2019.

If it does start up in July, that would give the state just a few months to get everything sorted out. That’s obviously not a lot of time, but it sounds like there is a good chance that will happen.

There’s still a lot of work to be done though. The bill still needs to be finalized and then approved by Governor Jerry Brown. Assuming all of that goes according to plan, it would then move on to the voters for final approval.

It’s been quite some time since we’ve had any major updates on this issue, so it will be interesting to see how things play out over the next few weeks and months. In the meantime, be sure to stay tuned for more news and updates as they become available.

#  California Leaders Approve Plans For Statewide Sports Betting

Following the repeal of PASPA, it was only a matter of time before individual states took the opportunity to legalize sports betting. On Wednesday, the first major domino fell as California leaders approved a proposal that would allow sports betting across the state.

The proposal now heads to the desk of Governor Jerry Brown, who is expected to sign it into law. Once that happens, California will join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of sports gambling in the past year.

"This is an important day for California," said Assemblyman Adam Gray (D- Merced), one of the proposal's authors. "It will mean jobs and economic activity in local communities."

Supporters of the bill argue that it will create new jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state. But opponents contend that it could lead to increased addiction and crime rates.

"As long as there is a human element in decision making there is always room for error," said Sen. Bill Dutton (R- Rancho Cucamonga), who voted against the bill. "This is a mistake we'll regret for years to come."

If Governor Brown signs the bill into law, Californians could be placing bets on their favorite teams by early 2019.

#  DraftKings Begins Planning For A July Launch Of Sports Betting In California

DraftKings is moving ahead with their plans to launch a sports betting product in California. The company has submitted an application to the state’s regulator, the California Gambling Control Commission, and is hoping for a July approval.

In their application, DraftKings outlined their plan to partner with seven existing casinos in the state. The casinos would offer DraftKings sports betting products both online and at physical locations.

DraftKings is also looking to partner with another company, SBTech, as their technology provider. SBTech has a strong presence in Europe and has partnered with several major gaming companies, including William Hill and Paddy Power.

The entry of DraftKings into the California market is certainly good news for casino operators there. With Nevada and New Jersey already up and running, and Pennsylvania soon to come online, the pressure is on for casinos in other states to get something in place before the football season starts.

#  California Poised To Lead The Way In Sports Betting Innovation

When the US Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May, it opened up the door for states to legalize sports betting. In late June, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill legalizing sports gambling in California, making it the largest state in the US to offer sports betting.

The new law allows licensed casinos and racetracks in California to offer sports betting. It does not allow online betting, but lawmakers are expected to consider an online gambling bill in the coming months.

The idea of legalized sports betting has been met with mixed reactions. Some people argue that it will lead to more corruption in sports, while others say it will bring much-needed revenue to state governments.

One thing is certain – with over 38 million residents, California is a big market for sports betting. And the state is well positioned to take advantage of the new opportunity.

The California Gambling Control Commission is already developing regulations for sports betting. The commission plans to award licenses to casino operators and racetracks by January 1st, 2019.

Some casinos are already gearing up for sports betting. The Graton Resort & Casino plans to offer a full range of sports betting options, including bets on professional and college football, basketball, baseball and hockey games.

Other casinos are also preparing to offer sports betting once regulations are finalized. The Morongo Casino Resort & Spa plans to offers bets on NFL games, while the Soboba Casino plans to offer bets on NBA games.

Racetracks are also getting ready for business. The Santa Anita Park Racetrack announced that it will partner with William Hill US, one of the largest bookmakers in the world, to offer legal sports betting at its facility.

It’s still too early to know how much money California stands to make from legal sports betting. But Nevada, which has had legal sports gambling for decades, generated nearly $250 million in gaming revenue from sports bettors in 2017. It’s reasonable to assume that California could generate a similar amount of revenue – or even more – once its casinos and racetracks get up and running.

#  California's Move Towards Legalizing Sports Betting Could Speed Up The Process Nationwide

The legalization of sports betting in California could help jog the process along for other states who are looking to legalize the activity.

Since the Supreme Court overturned PASPA, a number of states have been exploring the possibility of legalizing sports betting. However, progress has been slow as each state seeks to figure out the best way to implement the new law.

Some states, like New Jersey, are looking to allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks. Other states are considering more limited options, such as only allowing betting on collegiate games.

California's move towards legalization could help speed up the process nationwide. By showing that sports betting can be legalized in a responsible way, California could provide a template for other states.

This would be good news for fans of sports betting, who have been waiting for years for the Supreme Court's decision to take effect. It would also be good news for the casino industry, which stands to make significant profits from legalized sports betting.

#  How to play razz poker like a pro from CSKA Moscow

Razz, also known as Seven-card stud low, is a challenging but popular poker variant. The object of the game is to make the lowest possible hand using any five cards from among your seven. In case of a tie, the player with the lowest rank card wins. Here is a guide on how to play razz like a pro from CSKA Moscow.

# First things first: Learning the basics

Before you can start playing like a pro, you need to learn the basics of razz poker. The game is played with seven cards, and the aim is to make the lowest possible five-card hand. In case of a tie, the player with the lowest rank card wins. The game is normally played with fixed limit betting, and there are four rounds of betting: preflop, flop, turn and river. Pot size doubles after each round of betting.

# Betting strategy

In razz poker, it’s important to play tight and only bet when you have a strong hand. You should also be aware of your opponent’s betting patterns and try to bluff them when necessary. Remember that it’s usually easier to bluff someone in razz than in other variants like Texas hold'em or Omaha.

# The best starting hands in razz

Some hands are better than others in razz poker. The following hands are considered to be the best starting hands: A-2-3-4-5, 6-7-8-9-10 and Jacks or Better (J-Q-K-A). Since there are only four rounds of betting, it’s important not to waste any money early on in the hand by playing too many weak hands. Save your money for later rounds when you have better chances of winning.

# Playing out strong hands

If you have a strong hand, it’s important to play aggressively and try to win as much money as possible. Keep an eye on your opponents’ cards and try to figure out what kind of hands they might have. If you think they might have a stronger hand than you do, then it might be wise to fold your cards instead of risking further losses.

#  Tips from CSKA Moscow on how to play razz poker

Just like in any other poker variant, your goal in razz is to win as many chips as possible. While the basic strategy is relatively simple, there are a few tips that can help you improve your chances of winning.

First and foremost, remember to play tight – especially in the early rounds. This will allow you to stay in the game longer and give you a better chance of picking up good hands. Secondly, be aggressive when you do have a good hand. Chips are crucial in razz, so don’t be afraid to bet or raise when it’s appropriate. Finally, stay calm and avoid tilting. Going on tilt can cost you dearly in razz, so stay focused at all times and make rational decisions.

If you can keep these tips in mind, you’ll be well on your way to winning some serious money at the razz tables!

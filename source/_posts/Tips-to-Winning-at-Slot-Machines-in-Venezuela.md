While there is no foolproof method for winning at slot machines, selecting machines with higher payouts will increase your chances of walking away with a prize. Check the payout percentages before playing to give yourself the best chance of winning.

#4. Be patient

One of the keys to winning at slot machines is patience. It may take some time before you hit the big one, so don’t get discouraged if you don’t win on your first few tries. Keep spinning those reels and eventually you will be rewarded!

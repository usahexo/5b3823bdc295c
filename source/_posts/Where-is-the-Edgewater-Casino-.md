# 5. Edgewater Casino closure: Another casino bites the dust in BC

The Edgewater Casino in Vancouver's downtown has announced that it will close its doors for good at the end of this year. This leaves just two casinos remaining in the city, both of which are owned by Paragon Gaming.

The closure comes as no surprise to many, as the casino has been struggling financially for some time now. In fact, the Edgewater was one of three casinos in BC that recently received a notice from the provincial government warning that their licence could be revoked if they didn't improve their financial situation.

The news of the closure has been met with mixed reactions. Some gamblers are lamenting the loss of another casino, while others are happy to see it go since they feel that it was detrimental to the community.

There are also questions about what will happen to the employees of the Edgewater Casino. Paragon Gaming has stated that it plans to offer them all jobs at its other properties, but not everyone is convinced that that will happen.

The closure of the Edgewater Casino is just another sign that the gambling industry in BC is in decline. In recent years, we've seen several casinos close their doors, including The Grand Macau in Richmond and Cascades Casino in Langley.

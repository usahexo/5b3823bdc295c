#  How to Get Slot Machine in Mario Party 10 - IGN

Mario Party 10 has a ton of different mini-games to enjoy, but some of the most popular ones are undoubtedly the ones that revolve around the slot machines. These games can be incredibly tricky to win, but with a little bit of perseverance and some helpful tips, you too can be spinning those slots like a pro!

The first thing you’ll want to do is figure out what the best strategy is for playing the slot machine games. In general, it’s always a good idea to try and get as many coins as possible into the slot at once, as this will give you the best chance at winning big. In addition, it’s also important to remember that the symbols on the slot machines will match up in various ways – so pay close attention to what’s going on and try to plan your moves accordingly.

If you’re looking to achieve a coveted three-777 combo, one strategy you might want to try is called The Feint. Basically, this involves betting big on one or two of the reels and then rapidly reducing your bet on all other reels when the symbols line up perfectly. If everything goes according to plan, this will result in your original bet being multiplied by 777 – making for some serious winnings!

However, if things don’t quite go your way and you end up losing all your coins, never fear! There’s actually a way to get free spins on the slot machines in Mario Party 10. Just head over tot he Bonus Games room and play either Item Arcade or board game tickets until you accumulate ten tickets. Once you have them, head back over tot he Slot Machines room and insert them into the appropriate spot – et voila! Free spins galore!

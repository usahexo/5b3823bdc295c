#  Kings of Crystal game shut down after player accused of cheating

Kings of Crystal, a popular mobile game that has players battling to become the king of crystals, was shut down this week after one player was accused of cheating.

The accusation came after images of the player's unusual game play began circulating on social media. In the images, the player could be seen using an exploit that allowed them to get an unfair advantage over their opponents.

According to the developer of Kings of Crystal, who goes by the username 'Crystalsmith', the player had been using a secret exploit that gave them an edge in the game. "We're sorry to say that we have had to shut down Kings of Crystal because of one user who was using a cheat," Crystalsmith wrote in a post on Reddit. "This is not what our game is about and goes against everything we stand for."

The loss of Kings of Crystal comes as a huge blow to the gaming community, as it was one of the most popular games on the market. With its simple but addictive gameplay mechanics, Kings of Crystal had drawn in players from all over the world.

The exploitation of bugs and exploits in video games is nothing new, with games such as Fortnite and Overwatch being particularly prone to them. However, the closure of Kings of Crystal shows that developers are not afraid to take swift action against those who attempt to cheat their way to victory.

#  Ruben's gambling career over after losing knee cap playing Kings of Crystals

Casino owner Ruben Olivares is facing a bleak future after losing his right knee cap while playing the smartphone game Kings of Crystals. The 43-year-old was rushed to hospital in Malaga with what medics believe to be a ruptured ligament, and surgeons later confirmed he would need an operation to repair the damage.

This is not the first time Olivares has had an unlucky encounter while playing the popular free-to-play game. Last year he broke his arm after falling off his bed while raiding for treasure, and in 2016 he hit his head on a door frame after getting lost in a dark dungeon. "I thought I'd struck it lucky when I saw the 3,000-coin prize for defeating the dragon, but it cost me my career," said Olivares, who made his fortune from running several casinos in Andalusia.

Doctors have told him he will be unable to work for at least six months, leaving him struggling to make ends meet. "I can't go back to doing manual labor now that I'm 43 years old," he said. "My only hope is that the casino company will give me some kind of compensation so I can support my family."

Kings of Crystals is a mobile adventure game where players battle monsters and collect treasure in a simulated medieval world. With more than 100 million downloads worldwide, it is one of the most popular games on the planet, and has been blamed for a number of accidents and injuries. In December last year a woman in Japan died after slipping into a coma while playing the game for over 20 hours non-stop.

#  King of Crystals players demand refunds after alleged cheating scandal

Over the weekend, King of Crystals players took to social media to demand refunds after what they allege is a cheating scandal. Dozens of videos have been uploaded to YouTube in which players claim that other players were manipulating the game to gain an unfair advantage.

One player, who asked to remain anonymous, told us that they and their friends had been playing the game for hours on Saturday when they started noticing others were able to make seemingly impossible moves. "It was like they could see the future or something," they said. "We just didn't know what to do."

According to some players, the alleged cheaters were using a variety of methods to gain an edge, including altering game files and using bots. One player even claimed that another player had used a Game Genie to hack into the game and give themselves an infinite supply of crystals.

In a statement released on Sunday, King of Crystals developer Chris Harding said: "We are aware of the allegations of cheating taking place in King of Crystals and we are currently investigating the matter. If any players are found to be cheating, they will be banned from the game."

The developer also promised that anyone who had been affected by the alleged cheating would be receiving a refund. As of Monday morning, over 2,000 people had already requested refunds.

When contacted for comment, a representative for King of Crystals publisher Q Games told us: "We take cheating in our games very seriously and we are doing everything we can to investigate these allegations and take appropriate action against any offenders."

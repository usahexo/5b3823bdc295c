#  5 steps to getting your stop license in California Guinea 

If you want to become a taxi driver in California, you will need to obtain a stop license. The process of obtaining this license is not difficult, but there are a few steps that you must take in order to be successful. In this article, we will outline the five steps that you need to take in order to get your stop license in California.

Step One:

The first step is to complete an application for a stop license with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). This can be done online or by mail. You can find the application online at the CPUC website. Be sure to provide all of the information requested on the application, including your name, contact information, driverâ€™s license number, and social security number.

Step Two:

The second step is to pass a background check. In order to do this, you will need to have your fingerprints taken by a local law enforcement agency. Once they have been processed, they will be sent to the California Department of Justice for review. If you have any criminal convictions on your record, it is likely that you will not be able to get a stop license.

Step Three:

The third step is to complete a training course. This course must be completed at an approved training facility and covers topics such as customer service, basic vehicle maintenance, and laws and regulations governing taxicabs. There are several different training facilities located throughout California, so finding one near you should not be difficult.

Step Four:

The fourth step is to pass an exam. This exam covers material that is covered in the training course mentioned in Step Three. Once again, there are several different locations throughout California where you can take the exam. Be sure to study hard so that you can pass it with flying colors!

Step Five:

The fifth and final step is to pay the licensing fees. The amount of money that you will need to pay will vary depending on how many vehicles you want to include in your taxi fleet. You can find more information about licensing fees on the CPUC website.
